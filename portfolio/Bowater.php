	<h1 class='PortfolioH1'>About</h1>
	<p class='PortfolioP' >A website designed for a University of Warwick SU election candidate. The client wished to update the site himself over the week in which he was campaigning so it had to be built on a content management system. I choose to use Joomla due to my familiarity with it and I knew that it had a WYSIWYG content editor which was required as the client was not very technologically literate. I did a fair bit of changing to the master template and added in some php plugins and got what you see below.</p>
