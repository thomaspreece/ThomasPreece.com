	<p class='PortfolioP' >While volunteering with the Warwick Technology Volunteers, one of my responsibilities was to maintain and update the website. As this is the first thing new volunteers see I had to update it to make it as user friendly as possible. The previous version of the website before I started working on it was very complicated to navigate and had lots of abandoned and non functional pages. This actually made finding out any information about the Technology Volunteers difficult so I cleaned up the site and added some better hyper-links and made sure the site was as user friendly as possible, which is very important as if the user gets frustrated with the site they are less likely to volunteer with us.</p>
